# Customer-Churn-Prediction

A Data Science based project(Kaggle Competition) to predict whether a Telecom Customer will leave the network (churn) or stay from a given training set of past churn data with comparison between different Training Models - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, K-Means Clustering & Boosting Classifiers.

The Project can be further divided into the following stages :

1. Data Acquisition, Cleansing & Transformation [Preprocessing]
2. Feature Engineering, Extraction & Selection.
3. Model Comparision and Training.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning.
5. Results Comparision.

[Platform - Jupyter - Python : NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn]
[Metric Used - Area Under curve(AUC)]

Kaggle Leaderboard Rank : Top 4th/36 Teams.
